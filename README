#          Event-based simulator for LoRa-based Bulk data transmissions           #
#                                                                                 #
# Description: The script considers a scenario where each node transmits as soon  #
# as it has a considerable amount of data. All nodes repsect the 1% radio         #
# duty-cycle restriction. The lowest possible SF is assigned to each node based   #
# on its distance to the gateway and the propagation model. The script takes as   #
# input the node positions as it is defined in the read_data sub. It outputs the  #
# data collection time and the average node energy consumption.                   #
#                                                                                 #
# Assumptions:                                                                    #
# -- All the transmissions are performed over the same channel                    #
# -- Acknowledgments are sent over a different channel                            #
# -- Collisions occur when two packets overlap in SF, time, and power             #
#    (capture effect)                                                             #
# -- All the nodes have the same BW/CR settings                                   #
#                                                                                 #
